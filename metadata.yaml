description: Ingred! Ingred, old girl! I say, Ingred! Wherever have you taken yourself
  off to? shouted a boyish voice, as its owner, jumping an obstructing gooseberry
  bush, tore around the corner of the house from the kitchen garden on to the strip
  of rough lawn that faced the windows. "Hullo! Cuckoo! Coo-ee! In-gred!" "I'm here
  all the time, so you needn't bawl!" came in resigned tones from under the shade
  of a large fuchsia. "You're enough to wake the dead, Chumps! What is it you want
  now! It's too hot to go a walk till after tea. I'm trying to get ten minutes peace
  and quiet!" Hereward, otherwise "Chumps," put his feet together in the second position,
  flung out his arms in what was intended to be a graceful attitude, and made a mock
  bow worthy of the cinema stage. "Have them by all means, Madam!" he replied in mincing
  accents. "Your humble servant has no wish to disturb your ladyship's elegant repose.
  He offers a thousand apologies for his unceremonious entrance into your august presence,
  and implores you to condescend - Ow! Stop it, you brute!"
